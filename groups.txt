# groups that are purely used for giving privileges to certain users to write to specialised helper sockets.
# this is mostly useful when the reading end has to be root to do it's job.
# see the backlight daemon thingy I made for an example.
# a simple "groupadd $groupname" will do, there's nothing special about them.


# group for the backlightctl socket used by the backlightlisten daemon
backlightctl
